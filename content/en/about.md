My name is Sigurd and I'm a norwegian AI researcher, student and engineer. I currently live in Sydney, Australia where I'm earning a MSc Artificial Intelligence at University of Technology Sydney (UTS).

> Did you know UTS has been [named](https://www.usnews.com/education/best-global-universities/artificial-intelligence) the third best university in the world for artificial intelligence? *Source: US News Education*

I grew up 78Â° north in Longyearbyen, Svalbard, a Norwegian archipelago close to the north pole where my father worked as a coal miner. Learn more about my story [here](https://vimeo.com/768086673).

I have experience working as Project Manager for Startuplab, Norway's largest and best tech incubator and investor. I also have experience working as an AI Research Engineer in Sydney. Currently, I'm focused on university and I intend to graduate in time by November 2024.
