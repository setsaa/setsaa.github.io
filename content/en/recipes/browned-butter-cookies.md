## Ingredients
- Unsalted butter - 200g
- Sugar - 100g
- Brown sugar - 200g
- Vanilla extract - 2ts
- Large Eggs - 2
- Flour - 300g
- Baking soda - 1/2ts
- Baking powder - 1/2ts
- Toffee candy bar - ~80g
- Chocolate - 200g
- Table salt
- Seasalt

## Method
1. Cook `200g unsalted butter` in a saucepan over medium heat, stirring often, until it foams, then browns. It should start to smell nutty. If it doesn't smell any different than regular butter, let it cook longer. Scrape into a large bowl and let cool slightly, until cool enough to touch (like the temperature of a warm bath), about 10 minutes.
2. Whisk `300g flour`, `1/2ts baking soda`, `1/2ts baking powder` and `1/2ts table salt` in a medium bowl.
3. Add `200g brown sugar` and `100g granulated sugar` to the browned butter. Using an electric mixer (either a stand mixer or hand mixer) on medium speed, beat until incorporated, about 1 minute. Add `2 large eggs`, room temperature and `2ts vanilla extract`, increase mixer speed to medium-high, and beat until mixture lightens and begins to thicken, about 1 minute. Reduce mixer speed to low; add dry ingredients and beat just to combine. Mix in `~80g chocolate toffee bars` (preferably [Smil](https://meny.no/varer/snacks-godteri/sjokolade/smil-rull-7040110648504)), chopped into small pieces and `200g chocolate` (preferably 72% cacao) with a wooden spoon or rubber spatula. Let dough sit in the mixing bowl at room temperature at least 30 minutes to allow flour to hydrate. Dough will look very loose at first, but will thicken as it sits.
4. Place a rack in middle of oven; preheat to 190°C, and line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Using an ice cream scoop, portion out balls of dough and place on prepared baking sheet, spacing apart so you can also form dough into ping pong–size balls with your hands. Do not flatten; cookies will spread as they bake. Sprinkle with flaky sea salt (not too much).
5. Bake cookies until edges are golden brown and firm but centers are still soft, 9–11 minutes. Let cool on baking sheets 10 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack and let cool completely. Repeat with remaining dough, using a cool baking sheet lined with fresh parchment paper.

Cookie dough can be made 3 days ahead; cover and chill in the refrigerator—or freeze for up to 3 months. Let dough come to room temperature before baking.
