Hei!

I am a master student in artificial intelligence at the University of Technology Sydney. I'm passionate about machine learning, deep learning, and computer vision. Currently, I'm working on my thesis project, which focuses on developing a novel deep learning model for neuron segmentation for [connectomics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connectome).

Originally from Svalbard, I have always been fascinated by technology and understanding the human brain. I have a bachelor's degree in cognitive science from the University of Bergen, where I specialized in computer science. Never boring, I also have a foot in the innovation sector, having worked for Startuplab and a few startups.

In my free time, I enjoy baking, cooking and hiking. I also love to travel and explore new cultures. I am always up for a good conversation, so feel free to reach out to me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sigurds).

All the best, \
*Sigurd*
