During my final year of my computer vision degree, I wrote a paper titled &amp;ldquo;Know Your Neighbour&amp;rdquo;. In it, I highlighted how techniques in machine learning can be used to improve the efficiency of what&amp;rsquo;s called &amp;ldquo;3-dimensional neuron segmentation&amp;rdquo;, i.e, the process of identififying neurons in 3D space. Both me and my supervisor were very happy with the results, so I decided to write this blog, explaining what it is, how it works and what implications it can have for the future of neuroscience.</description>

My name is Sigurd and I&amp;rsquo;m a norwegian AI researcher, student and engineer. I currently live in Sydney, Australia where I&amp;rsquo;m earning a MSc Artificial Intelligence at University of Technology Sydney (UTS).
Did you know UTS has been named the third best university in the world for artificial intelligence? Source: US News Education
I grew up 78Â° north in Longyearbyen, Svalbard, a Norwegian archipelago close to the north pole where my father worked as a coal miner.</description>
