In the quest to unravel the intricate wiring of the brain, the field of connectomics has emerged as a crucial frontier. This discipline focuses on mapping neural connections at the level of individual synapses and neurons. However, the vast scale and complexity of neural circuits pose significant challenges in data acquisition, analysis, and interpretation. This blog post explores how deep learning, specifically using the U-Net architecture, can revolutionize neuron segmentation in electron microscopy (EM) images, a task essential for advancing our understanding of brain connectivity.
