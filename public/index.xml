      <description>Image: Scan of a part of nervous tissue. Bioscience Image Library, Fayette Reynolds.&#xA;During my final year of my computer vision degree, I wrote a paper titled &amp;ldquo;Know Your Neighbour&amp;rdquo;. In it, I highlighted how techniques in machine learning can be used to improve the efficiency of what&amp;rsquo;s called &amp;ldquo;3-dimensional neuron segmentation&amp;rdquo;, i.e, the process of identififying neurons in 3D space. Both me and my supervisor were very happy with the results, so I decided to write this blog, explaining what it is, how it works and what implications it can have for the future of neuroscience.</description>
